with Ognjen Perric
Experimentally test some performance of Linear Bandit Algorithms such as epsilon greedy, LinUCB, LinTS
We created a Multi-Armed Bandit environment, chose a performance metric and justified it. 
We also used the Sherman Morrison method to reduce time complexity in UCB.
In one word: we just exposed some cases like the number of arm bandits we choose where some algorithm could be better than others, and demonstrate the performance of Lin UCB and Lin TS both in fixed action set/non fixed action set.

Another project is to come by the end of December !! Let's keep updated
