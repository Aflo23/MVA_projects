Lab 7 of the Altegrad Class at MVA 

Part I I implement the DeepSets model. 
I evaluate the model in the task of computing the sum of multisets of digits 
and compare it against traditional models such as LSTMs.

Part II is on Graph generation 
visualize.ipynb is the notebooks where I computed the result


For now, I still have concerns in my eval function for Part I.
