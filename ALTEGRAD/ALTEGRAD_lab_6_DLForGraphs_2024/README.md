Project 6 MVA Altegrad

This project is to explore neural network specifically on graphs 

Part I:
I implemented a graph neural network 
which belongs to the family of **message passing models**

Part II:
I implemented a graph neural network that operates at the graph level,
and the model will be evaluated in a graph classification task
