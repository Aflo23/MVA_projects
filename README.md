# MVA_projects
I try to update some of my projects I ve done in MVA classes as much as possible 
Here are a few of the mandatory classes I ve chosen during the 1st semester
- reinforcement learning (E.Rachelson and C.Vernade)
- ALTEGRAD (about Text, Graphs Methods) (Vazirgiannis, Zhang, Fei) 
- Neuroscience (Weltz, Cormier)
- Convex Optimization (D'Aspremont)
